            I’ve always been interested in computers and their ins and outs ever since I was young. This lead me into studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Kenyatta University. Unfortunately, this didn’t really teach me much about programming which was the area in computing I was most interested in.

            I joined Moringa School, a 6-month intensive coding bootcamp here in Nairobi, in May 2017 and it was the best decision I ever made in my journey into becoming a programmer. Not only did I become a very proficient in programming languages such as Javascript, Typescript and Java, I learned how to work with peers in areas such as sharing ideas, sharing responsibilities and solving disagreements amongst ourselves as we worked. There’s a joke in the programming community that if it takes a programmer 1 day to finish a job, it will take 2 programmers two days to finish it. At Moringa School, I was taught how to plan and manage my time in such a way that projects would usually end up finished right in time regardless of whether I was working alone or within a group.

              I have worked on a lot of applications while at Moringa School and also during my free time. My favorite being Moringa Salon and SupaPrice. Moringa Salon was a web application built on Java and Postgresql that allowed a salon to manage its employees and clients. The salon management could book appointments, manage staff by adding new employees and seeing which clients they attended to. SupaPrice was a web application that aggregated the prices of products across the four main supermarket chains in Kenya (Naivas, Nakumatt, Tuskys and Uchumi) so that people could see where they could find their shopping goods at the cheapest price. This would enable them to make a decision on where to do their shopping based on cost. SupaPrice was made using EmberJS, Node and Firebase.
